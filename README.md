# AirBnB Project

- This project is a command-line interface for managing data for an AirBnB clone. It is part of the Holberton School Full-Stack Software Engineer program.

## Usage
The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode.

- In interactive mode, simply run ./console.py and you will be prompted with a command-line interface. You can then enter commands to manage the data.

- In non-interactive mode, you can pipe commands to the console. For example, to list all of the objects, you would run the following command:

echo "all" | ./console.py

## Commands
The following commands are available:

- all - List all of the objects.
- count - Count the number of objects of a given type.
- create - Create a new object.
- destroy - Destroy an object.
- help - Display help for a command.
- quit - Quit the console.
